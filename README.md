## Howto

The stimuli is provided in data/. It can be regenerated with the stimuliPD.py script. 

Run Bash scripts (/src/scripts/*.sh) for training, test and evaluation. 

Scripts in src/analyses can be used to reproduce figures and analyses reported in the ACL2022 paper.

All the reported simulations are based on [my forked version](https://github.com/rgalhama/diora) of DIORA (Drozdov et al., 2019), which removes dependency on pre-trained embeddings.
